# PlacePicker
Place Picker for Google Maps has been deprecated in Android and we are told to move to paid APIs. Autocomplete, Nearby and Places photos APIs are chargeable after a number of loads. [Check Pricing here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/)

Thankfully, Static and Dynamic Maps on Mobile and Geocoder is still free. PlacePicker is a Place Picker alternative library that allows you to pick a point in the map and get its coordinates and Address using Geocoder instead of Google APIs

## Adding PlacePicker to your project

Include the following dependencies in your top level build.gradle:
```
repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
```
and this app's build.gradle :

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.suchoX:PlacePicker:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## How to use

1. You need a Maps API key and add it to your app. [Here's How](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup)
2. To start The `PlacePickerActivity`:

```
val intent = PlacePicker.IntentBuilder()
                .setLatLong(40.748672, -73.985628)  //Initial Latitude and Longitude the Map will load into
                .showLatLong(true)  //Show Coordinates in the Activity
                .setMapZoom(12.0f)  //Map Zoom Level. Default: 14.0
                .setAddressRequired(true) //Set If return only Coordinates if cannot fetch Address for the coordinates. Default: True
                .build(this)
            startActivityForResult(intent, Constants.PLACE_PICKER_REQUEST)
```
3. Then get the data `onActivityResult`
```
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int,resultCode: Int,data: Intent?) {
        if (requestCode == Constants.PLACE_PICKER_REQUEST) {
            if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            val addressData = data?.getParcelableExtra<AddressData>(Constants.ADDRESS_INTENT)
            }
        } else {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
        }
    }
```
